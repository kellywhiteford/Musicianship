# Musicianship
Experiment code for multi-site replication study examining the relationship between musical training and neural and perceptual sound processing. Any folder with a number corresponds to a task. For the full study, the tasks will be run in the order that they are numbered. Each numbered folder contains a word document with instructions for how to run the corresponding task. The preregistration protocol associated with this code is available at https://osf.io/duq34/.

# Requirements
- [AFC (version 1.40.1)](http://medi.uni-oldenburg.de/afc/download.htm)
- [Matlab 2016b](https://www.mathworks.com/)
- Matlab 2016b [patch](https://www.mathworks.com/login?uri=%2Fsupport%2Fbugreports%2F1445234) for audioplayer
- [Psychtoolbox (version 3.0.15)](http://psychtoolbox.org/download)
- SpeechInformational requires wav files, available at https://osf.io/n2wzj/. 
- HINT and QuickSIN require wav files from Nilsson et al. (1994) and Killion et al. (2004). The stimuli must be purchased and are not open source. 
- EEG_da and EEG_mi3 require wav files from Parbery-Clark et al. (2009, JNeuro) and Wong et al. (2007). To access the stimuli, contact the [Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory](https://brainvolts.soc.northwestern.edu/).  

# Getting Started
1. Download all code, AFC, and Psychtoolbox.
2. Read [Instructions for Initial Setup_Final.docx](https://osf.io/gydrh/).
3. For experiment-specific instructions, read the instructions within each numbered folder.
